# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

During the second phase, our UX team utilized cognitive walkthroughs to analyze the quality of our DAWS, this is important because it allows us the ass the interface from a new user's point of view. The goal is to provide our users with easy-to-use software, and by using our personas and scenarios from our previous phase we were able to create wireframes using some of their needs in mind. The purpose of these wireframes is to reveal the main features of the software and in certain cases depict how the software should be navigated. The cognitive walkthroughs are taken from an external evaluator, someone else who is looking to execute a specific goal, if the goal was met then the wireframes were created properly, however, if they did not meet the intended goal then changes would have to be made.

## Findings

While performing the cognitive walk-throughs, three tests were conducted by external evaluators or people who are not from our team, in doing so these external evaluators can give proper and reliable feedback for our fireframes. The three external evaluators took on the role of some of our personas and tried to execute what that person was trying to do, during the first stages of the wireframes many important key details were missing, however, as the wireframes progressed the needs of the personas were able to be met.

## Conclusions

Thanks to our wireframes and cognitive walkthroughs along with communications with our SE counterparts we were able to get a better idea of what the end product should look like. Our wireframes didn't convey appropriatly that DAWdle uses a "node based system", it just looked like your typical DAW following industry conventions, which are project certianly isn't. Going forward we are going to alter our existing wireframes to reflect the node based nature of DAWdle, things like added lines to show the relationships between the different parts of the DAW, as well as showing that the piano roll is just a single node that can expanded to configure, customize, and make melodies on. Overall, our findings made us realize that we should actually be pushing the envelope on breaking some DAW conventions, as we want to highlight our unique node based system rather than obfuscate it in conventions. 

## Caveats

The largest caveat is that we only had two cognitive walkthroughs, so we were working with less than many other groups in the class. Also, at times we didn't get important information from our SE teams until we asked for it, but the response back with the relevant info was always prompt so it never really became an issue. Other than that, there aren't really any more caveats to consider for DAWdle this sprint.
