    - Used competitive analysis to assess the competition to see where today's DAWs fall short of consumer's expectations
        - DAW consumers, especially those not using them for their job at a company are tired of expensive subscription plans and paid plugins 
        - Many DAWs follow the same conventions (i.e. piano roll on the left, sound library on far left), offering limited customizability on the layout / keyboard bindings
## Methods

    To begin, our UX team performed competitive analyses on 5 seperate competitors that are already established in the industry to get inspiration and see what could be improved in our application. We evaluated competitors based on 5 different metrics: Strengths, Weaknesses, Quality, Platforms, and Cost (platform ended up not mattering due to DAWdle being Windows exclusive). We made sure to find a variety of payment options for the competition, from one-time liscense fees, to subscription plans, to free open-source software. 

    Next, we created a series of personas and scenarios where we hypothesized about how users may interact / respond to our software. We gave them distinct personalities for the personas and created unique situations for the scenarios to better understand who, what, and how others will interact with our software.
    
    Our last research method we used was heuristic evaluation, in which we evaluated one of the products we investigated during the competitive alalysis phase of our project. We decided to evaluate FL Studio 20, a go-to to many producers, particularly in the hip-hop and electronic music genres. We evaulated it on a scale of 1-10 on a variety of different aspects of the software. The aspects we evauluated were visibility of the system status, match between the system and the real world, user control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, recognition rather than recall, flexibility and efficiency of use, helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, and lastly: help and documentation. Detailed notes were used to document the scores and justify them.

## Findings
    
    In our competitive analysis, the reason why we sought out one-time-buy, subscription, and open source DAWs is due to the common complaint that DAWs are too expensive, especially those with subscriptions, and we wanted to know what an expensive DAW would get you compared to a free, open source DAW. The difference in quality was large, but not unreconciliable, especially with the potential to build whatever you need with open source software. We also used the analysis to learn about the types of demographics that would be using our products. We determined that the target demographic for this product would be DJ's, producers, musicians, and audio engineers

    As expected, all personas had something to do with a desire to create music or plugins of some sort. By doing this excersise, we were able to get a better understanding of what our prodcut will actually be, something to make and refine music with, not for exclusively mixing and mastering audio like some other DAWs. It gave us important insight on how people will use our product and helped refine our areas of focus for the UX side of the project.


## Caveats

    Our work so far does come with its caveats. The most glaring one being that we are not involved in any capacity in the software development half of this project, other than attending a few of the meetings that the SE team has had so far. We also were not familiar with any of the research methods prior to using them. Another is that we have no user data to go off of, because we haven't demonstrated the MVP yet to the class. Also, none of us were familiar with using DAWs prior to this project, so most of our knowledge regarding DAW conventions and other such things were learned as we were going through the different research methods.
